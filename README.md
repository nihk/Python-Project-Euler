# Python-Project-Euler

This repo will hold a bunch of short programs I've written to help me learn Python, a programming language I've been
meaning to become better accustomed with for a while now. I'm also writing these programs to hone my chops in
writing quicker algorithms to problems with many different solutions of varying efficiency. I include lengthy, 
sometimes numbingly exhaustive comments in a few of the programs; these are included to reflect my understanding of the
different solutions to these problems but mostly to help me re-understand them when I inevitably come back here a few months
from now with a mind entirely purged of the methodologies I'd originally employed here.

The programs will be based off of the Project Euler questions located here:
